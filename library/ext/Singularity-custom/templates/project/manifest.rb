  Welcome to Singularity! Grids Without Limits.

  See our Getting Started guide at http://singularity.gs to get started and for full documentation.

  If you need support for IE6/7, you should install the Border Box polyfill. Simply type `compass install singularitygs/box-sizing` in your command line from the root of your project folder (where config.rb is).
