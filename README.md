# Getting started

This framework utilizes SASS + Compass + Compass Extensions. To compile these there are a number of GUI apps that can take care of this for you. [Fire.app](http://fireapp.handlino.com/) and [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) are two choices. If you prefer to create your own set up, you can refer to this document on [installing SASS and Compass across platforms](http://snugug.com/musings/installing-sass-and-compass-across-all-platform).
