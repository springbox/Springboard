# Springboard

Springboard is a front-end framework to give you a giant leap forward when you begin any web project.

## Getting started

There's a number of tools that can help you get started quickly in front-end environments. [Fire.app](http://fireapp.handlino.com/) and [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) are two excellent choices that include features like auto-refresh, CSS preprocessor support and HTML/Javascript/CSS build options.

### Javascript

Best practices for JS are included in example files.

### SASS + Compass

This framework utilizes SASS + Compass. In addition to the choices above, if you prefer to create your own set up, you can refer to this document on [installing SASS and Compass across platforms](http://snugug.com/musings/installing-sass-and-compass-across-all-platform).

Compass comes with a number of built-in functions that can be quite useful (sprites, css reset, etc.). The full documentation can be found: [http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/)
